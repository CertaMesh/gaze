## [Unreleased]

## [v0.3.1] — 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **NER silent no-op with BIO-prefixed labels.json.** `LabelMap::resolve`
  now accepts both BIO-prefixed (`B-PER`, `B-LOC`) and bare (`PER`, `LOC`)
  label keys. Previously, bundles shipping BIO-prefixed labels (the standard
  Davlan/HuggingFace format) produced zero detections silently. Adopters on
  aarch64-apple-darwin were particularly affected. (#19)
- Spec-drift: `[session]` policy.toml key now authoritative over
  `--session-ttl`. (#16)
- Spec-drift: Broken `[ner] model_dir` exits `PolicyConfig` (exit code 2)
  instead of silently degrading. (#16)
- Spec-drift: `kind = "column"` policy rules rejected by `gaze clean` CLI
  load. (#16)

### Added

- `tracing::info!("ner detector registered, N backends")` on NER bootstrap -
  adopters can now confirm whether [ner] block is being picked up. (#19)
- `tracing::warn!` on zero-overlap (NER inference ran but emitted 0 entities
  for input class) - surfaces silent detection failures. (#19)

### Changed

- README hero copy + project north star documentation refresh. (#15)
- Roadmap documentation for v0.4 / v0.4.1 / v0.5. (docs-only,
  offsite-readable)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-24

### Changed

- **Counter-family tokens now wrap in angle brackets.** `<Email_1>`,
  `<Name_1>`, `<Custom:order_id_1>`. Format-preserving email tokens
  (`email1@example.test`) stay bare — angle brackets defeat the
  format-preserving purpose.

### Added

- **`crate::token_shape` module** exposing `pattern()` +
  `contains_token()`. Centralizes the token grammar the CLI's Pass 2
  hallucination detector uses. Drift-gate fixture forces compile
  errors if `PiiClass` grows without grammar updates.
- **Exhaustive Pass 1 + Pass 2 regex for wrapped tokens.** Pass 1 uses
  a delimiter-sensitive match (angle brackets serve as explicit
  delimiters); Pass 2 whitelists via `contains_token()`.
- **`docs/policy.md`** — user-facing `policy.toml` authoring guide.

### Fixed

- PR #10 follow-up — `Custom:` namespace round-trip + hallucination
  tests.
- **Homebrew formula SHA placeholders replaced** with the real
  `gaze-aarch64-apple-darwin` digest
  (`baa7edb79d84fea5d74377f82877c5069d861381a9f6012aa55af2264a8287f4`)
  once the tag-triggered release workflow published the binary. Closes
  the rc.1 "Known gaps" entry — `brew install Naoray/gaze/gaze` now
  resolves without the cask fallback.

## [0.3.0-rc.2] — 2026-04-23

Same contents as rc.1 — only the release workflow matrix changed
(x86_64-apple-darwin dropped). rc.1 was tagged but its workflow never
published a release: the `macos-13` Intel runner pool could not
allocate a runner for the x86_64 build, leaving the release job blocked
on an unmet dependency. Markus is on Apple Silicon, so dropping x86_64
for rc unblocks the adapter retarget immediately; Intel + Linux return
in a later rc when runner strategy is worked out.

## [0.3.0-rc.1] — 2026-04-23

First release candidate of the standalone `gaze` CLI. Ships the
subprocess contract that language-specific adapters (e.g.
`gaze-laravel`) target. Library API surface continues to evolve in
parallel — the CLI protocol is the stable seam.

### Added

- **Standalone `gaze` CLI with pipe-mode subcommands.** `gaze clean`
  consumes plaintext on stdin and emits `{text, session_blob}`;
  `gaze restore` consumes `{text, session_blob}` and emits the
  rehydrated original. Adapters shell out rather than linking the
  library.
- **Two-pass restore.** First pass matches exact tokens via
  `Session::tokens()`; second pass runs a shape validator over the
  surviving text to catch reformatted token placeholders. Addresses
  the counselors-review finding that single-pass restore silently
  skipped renders.
- **Session TTL enforcement.** Snapshots carry `issued_at` and
  `Session::import` rejects blobs past the configured TTL with a
  `BlobExpired` error (CLI exit bucket 3). Prevents stale blobs from
  leaking tokens across restarts.
- **Policy TOML loader.** `Policy::load` parses a user-supplied
  `policy.toml`; `Pipeline::from_policy` builds the detection engine
  from it. `gaze --policy path/to/policy.toml` wires the file into the
  CLI.
- **Typed `CliError` variants with exit buckets and stderr JSON
  protocol.** `UnknownToken`, `Tamper`, `VersionByte`, `EmptyInput`,
  `InvalidEncoding`, `BlobExpired`, `MaxBytes`, plus a panic hook that
  funnels unexpected failures into the same structured protocol.
- **`--max-bytes` input size cap.** Rejects oversize input with a
  structured error instead of allocating unbounded buffers.
- **`--session-ttl` flag.** Overrides the default blob lifetime per
  invocation.
- **`--format=json` flag.** Stats output (`{detections, runtime_ms,
  ...}`) for adapter observability.
- **Pipe-mode integration suite.** Roundtrip, canary, `UnknownToken`,
  tamper, version-byte, argv, panic, and stats coverage.
- **Homebrew formula skeleton** at `dist/homebrew/gaze.rb`. SHAs
  filled post-release.
- **GitHub Actions release workflow** at `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
  Tag-triggered macOS builds (darwin-arm64 + darwin-x86_64).

### Changed

- **Workspace refocus: ghostwriter crate removed.** v0.2's
  language-specific `ghostwriter` crate was deleted in favour of the
  channel-agnostic `gaze` CLI. Adapters now consume the subprocess
  contract instead of linking a Rust library.
- **Custom class namespace fix.** Custom-class tokens are emitted as
  `Custom:{name}_N` rather than colliding with built-in class names.
- **`stats.detections` counter excludes `Preserve`.** Preserve-action
  hits are not real detections; they no longer inflate the count.
  Dead `Structured` dispatch branch dropped.

### Fixed

- Session snapshot payload carries an `issued_at` timestamp — previous
  layout had no basis for TTL enforcement.

### Known gaps (deferred)

- **Linux x86_64 binary not built.** The `ort` (ONNX runtime)
  dependency needs bundled system libraries; folded into a later rc
  to avoid blocking Markus on the adapter retarget.
- **Homebrew SHAs are placeholders** until the workflow publishes the
  darwin binaries; follow-up commit fills them.
