## Tenant class names in tests

Test fixtures and benchmark labels MUST use neutral class names (e.g. `class_alpha`, `tenant_class_a`, `dict_alpha`), never tenant-specific patterns like `order_id`, `Order_42`, `Song_42`, `User_7`. Rationale: drawer `eac549ae` — gaze core has no built-in tenant knowledge.

The `cargo run -p xtask -- no-tenant-knowledge` gate scans production Rust code in `crates/{gaze,gaze-recognizers,gaze-assembly,gaze-cli}/src/**/*.rs` and fails on those tenant-specific patterns. It intentionally does not scan `tests/`, `benches/`, docs, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `crates/xtask/`, or `debug-proxy/`.

Use `// allow(tenant-fixture)` only in tests, benches, or docs when a tenant-like fixture is necessary to exercise behavior. That marker is a production-bypass attempt in `crates/*/src/` and hard-fails the gate with `AllowMarkerInProductionScope`.

The `order_id` denylist is intentionally broad — it catches `Order_42`, `order_ids`, etc. If a legitimate production identifier (e.g. `order_history_index_id` for an unrelated subsystem) collides with the denylist post-v0.4.3, coordinate with maintainers to add to allowlist with rationale comment. Do NOT silently bypass via `// allow(tenant-fixture)` in production code — that marker hard-fails the gate (drawer `eac549ae`).

Round-trip, three-surfaces, and recognizer-composition cross-cutting rows are N/A for this structural gate: it emits no tokens, adds no runtime knobs, and does not compose recognizers. The no-tenant-knowledge row is enforced by CI so production code must pass post-merge.
